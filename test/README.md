#The purpose of the test folder is to hold all the tests related to
#the production and deployment of our project

#Testing framework and development dependencies
    #Mocha test framework
    #Chai assertion library

#Why the name test?
    #Running the mocha command in your CLI by default looks for the folder with name "test"
    #and executes each and every "decribed" test inside the particular folder
    
#By running npm test you can run all the tests in the current folder
#The "npm test" command is set to run asynch everytime the server is initialized
